The example application is a simple text editor with network awareness.

Open and Save actions perform QUrlOperator based file access, thus
enabling the editor to load and save from non-local locations,
for example a file on an FTP server.

To do this simply insert an FTP directory URL in the directory
combobox of the Qt file dialog.

When the application has the KDE plugin loaded you can also use
any of KDE's IO slave protocols, for example sftp or webdav.
