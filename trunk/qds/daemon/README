On Unix the access to desktop services depends on the currently available
desktop API.

QDS uses D-BUS (http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus) to do
out-of-process method calls to a suitable service provider.

This could be a desktop environment specific program or the
QDS-Daemon which is part of the QDS package.

The QDS-Daemon handles different desktop APIs by delegating the service 
initialization/calls to a service plugin.

Which plugin is used depends on three items:
- if there is a plugin name specified on the daemon's commandline
- if there is a plugin name specified in the QDS configuration file
- if QDS can detect which desktop API it is being executed on

A name specified on the commandline using the commandline switch 

--plugin=pluginname

overrules any plugin name found in the configuration file.

Possible QDS configuration file qdsrc (for users in $HOME/.qt/) specifying to
use the KDE plugin (libqds_kde.so) if no override is given on commandline:

[General]
Plugin=kde

When there is neither a name given on commandline nor a name specified in
the configuration file, QDS will try to detect known desktop APIs before it
falls back to built in services.
